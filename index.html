            <p class="paragraph">I am a senior attending the Colorado University at Boulder. My major is Integrative Physiology with a Pre-Med interest,
            and after graduating with my undergraduate degree I plan to take a year off to shadow different occupations in the medical field
          while applying to medical school. I am a certified EMT and currently working as an aide at Boulder Community Health Hospital.
          My current medical interests are pediatrics, infectious diseases, neurology, and psychology. I am also a Technology, Arts, and Media minor, through which I can pursue my passion for
        digital arts and expand my mediums for artistic expression. I enjoy character building and world building the most, and my
      interests lean heavily towards science fiction. Most recently, 3D modeling and novel writing are my favorite creative outlets.</p>

            hourglass tapering of the body for the female model. The face blends human and bestial characteristics, opting for
          an elongated animal muzzle and human eyes with prominant brow ridges. This model is in the standard "T-pose",

              feathers. This model was later 3D-printed with a wood-based filament.

              without a happy ending, as this reflected my actual reality at the time. Instead of experiencing a "happy ending", this
              animation look at accepting failure and the pain that must be endured for acceptance to happen.

            <p class="paragraph">What had been intended as a quick mini-animation for a professor quickly became a month-long
              project with the addition of the fur detailing. Each strand of hair was rendered seperately, causing the video rendering
              to lag and causing multiple crashes. While the fur does look detailed and realistic, it has a long way to go, inspiring
              further projects - which are still under development - to develop a better texture for the model. Curiously, with the fur
              texture in place, the model was often recieved as a bear or different animal, prompting further projects to re-model the character
              into a more feline-like figure.

            <p class="paragraph">In this design project, multiple detailed models were created to produce our ideal environments. In this model, note the prominence of nature themes, such as the
              plant wall and running water. Furthermore, note the dichotomy of large open spaces for creative thinking with small crannies for focussed work. Also notable is the space dedicated to
              creative design, as this is a highly-valued aspect of my life and living areas. This animation showcases new skills in texturing and rendering previously unseen in my animated works.

            <p class="paragraph">This animation recounts a traumatic event in my life in which I was involved in a serious car crash. This is my first stop-motion animation, and was hand-drawn at
              10 frames per second. Note how this fps and hand-drawn style creates a jumpy, choppy video. This effect, along with the use of white outlines on a black background, create a tone of
              disorientation and danger.

            <p class="paragraph">The first book I ever wrote, this story focusses on perservearance and resilience, as well as how one experiences physical and mental trauma. Note that the
              illustration is hand-drawn and colorized, which was later cleaned up using Photoshop.

            <p class="paragraph">The prequel to Nadiline's story, this book looks back into the main character's origins. Where Nadiline's Story looks at the use and effect of perservearance,
              Rookie looks at the journey to build perservearance and resistance. Note that the cover is digitaly illustrated instead of hand-drawn, to improve the quality of the image and create
              a more metalic texture.

            <p class="paragraph">Diverging from young adult novels, this book is writen for young children, and describes the relationship between a dove and an angel. This piece was writen as
              a Mother's Day gift, and contains strong messages of love, nuturing, and growth. The book is interactive, containing places for children to draw their own perseptions of what the
              story looks like and encouraging them to think deeper about the book's main topics.

            <hr>
            <p class="paragraph">As with The Little Angel, this book was writen as a Mother's Day gift. It contains two different short stories, each of which reflect on the positive impact
              mothers have on their children. Each story comes with its own illustration. Note how both illustrations share the same style, which relies on simplification of shapes and shadows.
